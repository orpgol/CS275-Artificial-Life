## Abstract

Computer simulations of life forms can provide valuable insight into how life forms function and evolve. 
A popular form of simulation is the evolutionary model, which we wish to utilize to explore how a physical environment can influence a creature's locomotion. 
Multiple copies of a simple base creature with a base set of movement parameters are placed in a 2D environment and are mutated, randomly shifting around their movement parameters. T
he creatures are then given tasks in the form of a fitness function. The highest scoring creatures are kept alive and copied, while the other creatures are culled. With our method, we are able to create a creature that can move reasonably well in a variety of 2D environments.
